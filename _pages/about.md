Hello! 

My name is <u>Wang</u> Di(/wɑŋ˧˥ ti˧˥/)(<u>王</u>頔). 

I am a prospective Ph.D. student in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley advised by [Prof Jaijeet Roychowdhury](https://jaijeet.github.io/jrpages/index.html). My research interests are in hardware accelerator design, both digital and analog approaches.

I have completed my bachelor degree at Nanyang Technological University in the Electrical & Electronic Engineering department. My specialization was Integrated Circuit Design. I did some IC-design related stuffs there too, including CNN accelerator design(my FYP project), DAC and LNA designs(my course projects).

Aside from IC design research, I was the system administrator and hardware manager at [NTUHPC](https://ntuhpc.org/) from 2022 to 2023. I joined [ISC22](https://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/events/student-cluster-competition/)(online) and [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/)(onsite). Configuring HPC servers is so much fun.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, reading, travelling and driving.
